Welcome to FRC 7525's Internal Docs!
===================================

7525 makes use of various libraries, both vendor provided and internal during the on-season.
In turn there is a lot of "tribal knowledge"-knowledge that can only be aquired through epirience on the team.
This documentation aims to limit such tribal knowledge, and condense what the team has done software wise so anyone
new to the controls subteam can easily pick it up.


.. note::

   Team members are free to contribute to this documentation. Our libraries should change and these docs should reflect that!
