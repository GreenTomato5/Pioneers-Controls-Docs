Prerequisites and Resources
==============

This documentation largley assumes you have a solid understanding of Java and the FRC controls system. Specifically
you should know about the various electrial components of the robot, what each does, and be familiar with the WPILIB and vendor APIs.

Resources
----------

.. important:: This documentation is not a replacement for the WPILIB documentation. It is meant to be a supplement to it and should be used in conjunction with it and other available resources. Students who engage with these outside resources (specifically chief/discord) are often able to learn much more quick ly and effectively than those who do not.

For learning these prerequisites there are a variety of resources:

- The `WPILIB docs <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/zero-to-robot/introduction.html>`_ are very comprehensive and will effectivley teach you how to program a robot given you have a understanding of Java or Cpp.

- For questions regarding WPILIB, and FRC programming in general the `FRC Discord <https://discord.gg/frc>`_ is a great place to ask questions and get help. There are acive members from nearly every vendor, the WPILIB developers, and lots of expirienced students. Don't be afraid to ask questions! You will certainly run into people will very strong opinions but most people are very helpful and willing to help you learn.

- `Chief Delphi <https://www.chiefdelphi.com/>`_ certainly is a resources, mabye not the best one, but its a resource. A lot of the forum posts aren't particularly helpful to students and the site is often cluttered with arguments between mentors. But there are some good apples in the bunch, the same community active on the main discord is active there and teams make build blogs and post their season progress!

- One of the most valuable resources are LPS (Lysiass Programming Server) and other discord servers specifically associated with software projects (Photon Vision, Choreo, etc.). Students are strongly encouraged to join these servers and engage with them activley. Again don't be afraid to ask question! Everyone in those servers is there to help you learn and grow as a programmer.

.. note:: For an invite to LPS and other non-main servers reach out to your programming lead for an invite.
