What Should YOU use?
=============

Alright, so we have discussed 4 of the main swerve solutions. What should you use?

.. Note:: We did not test Max-Swerve so we cannot comment on it. According to other teams there are massive issues with it though. To learn more consult LPS!

That depends on your skill level, resources, and goals. If you're in the offseason and want to learn how swerve works write custom code! If your programming SubsystemStates
consists of 0 confident proficient members then use YAGSL, if you want a streamlined system and can spend the hundreds on CTRE products go for CTRE Swerve!

The most important thing is that you're satisfied with the solution you choose, every solution we've presented here is valid and will and has worked for other teams.
