Programming Dashboards
========================

A variety of dashboards are available to help program and debug your robot. We use dashboards to change configuration values on the fly, viisualize data, and get information about the robot's state.
The most common dashboards we use are:

* **SmartDashboard**: This is the default dashboard that comes with WPILib. It allows you to visualize data and change configuration values on the fly but it is pretty basic and doesn't look very good. You can learn about is `here <https://docs.wpilib.org/en/stable/docs/software/dashboards/smartdashboard/smartdashboard-intro.html>`_.
* **AdvantageScope**: This is a programmers ultimate dashboard. It has 3d visualization and many other features that make it extreamly useful. You can learn about it `here <https://docs.advantagescope.org/>`_. or learn how to use it for sim `here <docs\source\tools\simulation\advantageScope.html>`_
* **Elastic**: This is essentially a nicer looking version of SmartDashboard. It is helpful for programming and debugging but is also the software we use to creeate our driver dashboards. You can learn about it `here <elastic.html>`_.
