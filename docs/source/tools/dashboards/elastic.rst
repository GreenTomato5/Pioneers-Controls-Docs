Elastic Dashboard
========================
Elastic is a dashboard that is used to visualize data and change configuration values on the fly. It is essentially a more polished version of SmartDashboard and is used for both programming and driver dashboards. This is the dashboard we use for our driver dashboards. It has a nice user interface and allows you to create custom dashboards with various widgets to display data in different formats.
.. note::
    You can learn more about Elastic and how to use it `here <https://frc-elastic.gitbook.io/docshttps://frc-elastic.gitbook.io/docs>`_.

Using Elastic
------------------------
To use elastic you will start by connecting to your robot (or simulation). Next you can click the "Add Widget" button to add widgets to your dashboard. You can add widgets for various data types such as numbers, booleans, strings, and more. You can also add graphs to visualize data over time.
You can use the settings button to change the appearance of the widgets and the dashboard as a whole. You can also use the "Save Dashboard" button to save your dashboard for later use.
You can also create multiple dashboards and switch between them.
