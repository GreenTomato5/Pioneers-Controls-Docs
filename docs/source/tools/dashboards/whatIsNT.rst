NT Dashboards
==============
Sometimes we want to be able to see and/or change values on the robot without having to deploy code. This is where NT and dashboards come in.

What is NT?
----------------
NetworkTables (NT) is a protocol used by FRC robots to communicate data between the robot and the driver station. It allows for real-time data transfer, enabling teams to send and receive information such as sensor readings, motor speeds, and other telemetry data.
There are many tools that use NT to display and change data on the robot. These tools are often referred to as "dashboards". They allow you to visualize data, change configuration values, and get information about the robot's state without having to deploy code.

Dashboards
----------------
We use a variety of dashboards. Some are best for programming and debugging, while others are better suited for driver use during matches. Here are some of the most common dashboards we use:
